# Linux Utilities

Various linux utility scripts I often have to rewrite a thousand times until I decide they need to just be saved somewhere. 

This includes my custom Firefox Dynamic Tab library, which will work on OSX/Windows platforms.

I also have a [/rust-utils/](https://github.com/drannex42/rust-utils) repo that should be merged here, but I haven't done that yet for some unknown reason.
